Spam Email Detection Using Machine Learning
Description:
Spam Email Detection is a classification problem where we train a machine learning model to distinguish between spam (unwanted emails) and ham (legitimate emails) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The model analyzes the email content and predicts whether it is spam or not.
Features:
1.Uses TF-IDF Vectorization to convert text into numerical data.
2.Applies Naïve Bayes classifier (a popular algorithm for text classification).
3.Evaluates performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
How It Works
1.Loads the dataset – Reads email/SMS messages with spam/ham labels.
2.Preprocesses the text – Removes special characters, stopwords, and applies stemming.
3.Converts text to numerical features – Uses TF-IDF Vectorization.
4.Trains a Naïve Bayes model – A classification algorithm suited for text data.
5.Evaluates performance – Computes accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Future Improvements
-Use Deep Learning (LSTMs, Transformers) for better accuracy.
-Integrate a real-time spam filter in email services.
-Implement Word Embeddings (Word2Vec, BERT) instead of TF-IDF.
